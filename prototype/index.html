      <p>The student life at UA Little Rock is typical of public universities in the United States.
        It is characterized by student-run organizations and affiliation groups that support social,
         academic, athletic, and religious activities and interests. Some of the services offered by 
         the UA Little Rock Office of Campus Life are intramural sports and fitness programs, diversity 
         programs, leadership development, peer tutoring, student government association,
         student support programs including groups for non-traditional and first-generation students,

         campus to downtown Little Rock enables students to take advantage of a wide array of recreational, 
         entertainment, educational, internship, and employment opportunities that are not available anywhere 
         else in Arkansas. </p>
