<h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
<p>For this project, I took inspiration from many other websites such as the official Space X and NASA website. Most of the color scheme and layout are fairly similar, albeit with a few changes, specifically within the home page. The home page has the most amount of information compared to the other pages, so I laid it out differently.</p>
<p>For the first draft, I did not focus on the minor details, as I was just trying to get the layout completed. As seen by the draft in the FAQ and Contacts pages, I just inserted the content without really making any changes in terms of the style. I was already satisfied with the Home Page alongside the History page, as I had already spent a lot of time working on those pages, and according to some of the peers and relatives I've shown my website to, they also agreed.</p>
<p>For the final draft, the only major changes I had to make were adding more style elements to the FAQ and Contact Page. For the FAQ page, I added style by lines and spaces between each detail element, that way they were separated and not all bunched together. For the Contact Page, I used a different website entitled Jotform in order to create a feedback form. I found that overall this website had more customizable options when creating a form. It even allowed me to insert some of my own custom css while creating the form, which helped me match the style with the rest of the website. The next thing I did was format some of the images on the homepage further to the right as some of the images were too close to the text content. The last change I made was changing the overall background color to a lighter shade, as it made the content of the pages easier to read and navigate through.</p>
<p>Overall, although the first and final drafts look very similar, I believe that the changes that I made overall helped the aesthetic and style of the website blend together more cohesively. If I were to make any more changes I would probably lay out the home page a bit differently similar to the layout of the other pages, that way it wouldn't be so content-heavy, unlike the other pages. </p>
