<h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
<p>For this project, I took inspiration from many other websites such as the official Space X and NASA website. Most of the color scheme and layout are fairly similar, albeit with a few changes, specifically within the home page. The home page has the most amount of information compared to the other pages, so I laid it out differently.</p>
<p>For the first draft, I did not focus on the minor details, as I was just trying to get the layout completed. As seen by the draft in the FAQ and Contacts pages, I just inserted the content without really making any changes in terms of the style. I was already satisfied with the Home Page alongside the History page, as I had already spent a lot of time working on those pages, and according to some of the peers and relatives I've shown my website to, they also agreed.</p>
<p>For the final draft, the only major changes I had to make were adding more style elements to the FAQ and Contact Page. For the FAQ page, I added style by lines and spaces between each detail element, that way they were separated and not all bunched together. For the Contact Page, I used a different website entitled Jotform in order to create a feedback form. I found that overall this website had more customizable options when creating a form. It even allowed me to insert some of my own custom css while creating the form, which helped me match the style with the rest of the website. The next thing I did was format some of the images on the homepage further to the right as some of the images were too close to the text content. I also added in JavaScript in order to make a transitional slideshow as seen on the History Page. The last change I made was changing the overall background color to a lighter shade, as it made the content of the pages easier to read and navigate through.</p>
<p>Overall, although the first and final drafts look very similar, I believe that the changes that I made overall helped the aesthetic and style of the website blend together more cohesively. If I were to make any more changes I would probably lay out the home page a bit differently similar to the layout of the other pages, that way it wouldn't be so content-heavy, unlike the other pages. </p>

<h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
<p>Progressive enhancement is a crucial concept in web development. Progressive enhancement is about building websites or web applications that work for everyone, regardless of their device, browser, or internet connection. It emphasizes starting with a solid foundation of semantic HTML, then layering on CSS for presentation, and finally adding JavaScript for enhanced functionality. This approach ensures that the core content and functionality are accessible to all users, including those with older browsers, disabilities, or other needs. In essence, progressive enhancement ensures inclusivity, accessibility, and resilience in web design, making it essential for creating robust and user-friendly online experiences.</p>
